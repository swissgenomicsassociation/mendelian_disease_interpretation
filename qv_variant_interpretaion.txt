criteria ppie_reporting logic=or desc="Record presence and fulfilment of patient or public representation (PPIE) requirements"

note "PPIE: For each case, record whether patient or public representation requirements were met according to context (clinical, research, or commercial)."
note "PPIE: Minimum record includes: opportunity for expert consultation, whether discussion occurred, and whether non-actionable findings were addressed."
note "PPIE: In commercial contexts, the report itself may satisfy this requirement if it conveys the relevant information clearly and accessibly without requiring direct consultation."
note "PPIE: In research or cohort studies, record whether participants were informed about data use and whether individual feedback was planned."
