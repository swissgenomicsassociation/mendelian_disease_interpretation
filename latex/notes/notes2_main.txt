Here is a generalised framework draft that aligns your goals into a guideline manifesto and technical scope for the **Swiss Genomics Association consensus guideline for evidence-based genomic variant interpretation in Mendelian disease**:

---

## purpose of the guideline

The Swiss Genomics Association guideline establishes a national standard for **how variants are identified, described, evidenced, evaluated, and reported** in Mendelian disease.
Its goal is not to replace existing tools or clinical expertise, but to ensure that **all genomic conclusions are technically traceable, clinically reasoned, and reproducible across institutions, software platforms and industry partners**.

---

## the challenge we address

Genomic interpretation has advanced faster than the standards governing **evidence transparency, variant traceability, and clinical justification**. This has created systemic risks:

* **variant descriptions lack durable identity**, often missing transcript, genome build, coordinate provenance, and versioning
* **evidence is unequally weighted**, with pathogenicity labels or algorithmic scores treated as conclusions rather than inputs for review
* **counter-evidence is not routinely captured**, even when it directly contradicts prioritised results
* **uncertainty, quality flags, population biases, and false-positive risk are inconsistently reported**
* **clinical decisions cannot always be reconstructed**, audited, or compared across datasets, laboratories, or software pipelines

Without shared standards, genomic medicine risks operating on results that **cannot be reliably traced, compared, or re-evaluated**, limiting clinical confidence and long-term data value.

---

## core principles of the guideline

The guideline requires that **every reported variant interpretation must satisfy these principles**:

1. **identity**
   The variant must be described with persistent and unique genomic coordinates, reference sequence, transcript, versioning and allelic state.

2. **provenance**
   The analytical origin must be traceable, including sequencing technology, caller, quality metrics, filters, transcript source, and annotation datasets.

3. **evidence traceability**
   Supporting and contradicting evidence must both be recorded with source, date, method, confidence, and limitations.

4. **mechanistic reasoning**
   Variant effect must be interpreted in the context of the **known disease mechanism for that gene**, not inferred from consequence class alone.

5. **inheritance validation**
   Zygosity, segregation, and mode of inheritance must be explicitly evaluated, not assumed from frequency or ranking.

6. **phenotype alignment**
   Clinical interpretation must demonstrate concordance with the patient phenotype and document where it does not.

7. **evidence balancing, not label inheritance**
   Pathogenicity assertions (e.g. clinvar) are evidence signals, not verdicts, and must be reconciled with population data, mechanism, and counter-evidence.

8. **quantified uncertainty**
   Reports must express confidence, ambiguity and disproving signals, rather than collapsing to a single unqualified label.

9. **algorithm-aware reporting**
   Tools may prioritise, score, or summarise, but their outputs require structured clinical validation before clinical use.

## what must be true before a variant is considered clinically actionable

No variant may be considered diagnostic or causal without explicit evaluation of:

| domain                   | required evaluation                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| analytical validity      | depth, allelic balance, strand support, artefact risk, mapping reliability              |
| population compatibility | frequency consistent with prevalence, penetrance, ancestry and inheritance              |
| mechanism alignment      | effect matches the established disease mechanism for that gene                          |
| inheritance evidence     | zygosity fits disease model, segregation evaluated if possible                          |
| phenotype coherence      | patient presentation fits gene-disease spectrum without unresolved contradictions       |
| gene-disease validity    | supported by curated clinical evidence, not proximity or model organism inference alone |
| variant precedence       | domain, residue, or mechanism supported by prior observations or functional data        |
| differential review      | competing explanations evaluated, not masked by rank order or scoring                   |

## outcomes the guideline enables

* **reproducible interpretation** across clinical and research environments
* **structured evidence accounting** that supports audit, dispute resolution and reanalysis
* **safe integration of AI and commercial tools** by requiring transparent evidence mapping rather than opaque conclusions
* **interoperable national data** suitable for clinical reuse, data federation and longitudinal patient evaluation
* **improved reporting standards** developed collaboratively with clinical, academic and industry partners

---

## position on software tools and commercial platforms

Variant interpretation platforms, scoring models, and AI systems are **essential accelerants** in modern genomics.
This guideline does not challenge their utility, but establishes that:

* **tool output is triage, not clinical justification**
* **ranking is not evidence**
* **pathogenicity labels are assertions, not proof**
* **automation must expose evidence, not replace it**
* **clinical interpretation requires structured human adjudication supported by algorithmic insight**

Our goal is **software-agnostic elevation of reporting standards**, co-developed with industry to support safer, clearer and more interoperable clinical genomics.

## scoring and evidence quantification (initial reference proposal)

Interpretation frameworks may optionally use structured scoring approaches to standardise evidence weighting and highlight confidence gaps.
A preliminary reference rubric is supplied for expert review, to support transparent evidence composition rather than replace clinical reasoning.

---

## summary

The Swiss Genomics Association guideline will:

* define the minimum technical and clinical evidence required to interpret a variant
* enforce traceable provenance for variant identity and supporting data
* mandate explicit review of supporting and opposing evidence
* establish reproducible standards for reporting certainty, uncertainty and clinical relevance
* enable software, laboratories and clinicians to operate using a shared evidential contract
* strengthen national infrastructure for genomic care, research and innovation

If you want, next I can produce:

1. a policy-ready 1-page executive summary
2. a longer manuscript introduction for journal submission
3. a figure or schematic of the evidence flow
4. a polished version of the scoring rubric with rationale
5. a draft reporting template for clinical results

Which one should we build next?
