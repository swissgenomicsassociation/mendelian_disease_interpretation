  abstract = {The Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) is a Swiss research infrastructure initiative that aims to facilitate the exchange of health-related data in a FAIR manner. The SPHN Dataset and SPHN RDF Schema form an essential part of the SPHN Semantic Interoperability Framework, which currently covers mostly clinical routine data. To facilitate the integration of omics data produced by the SPHN National Data Streams, a genomics extension was developed. This was done in close collaboration with clinicians, researchers, bioinformaticians, and data managers, from Swiss university hospitals, academic research groups and the omics platforms. Here, we present the genomics extension of the SPHN RDF Schema, which can be used to semantically describe genomics experiments and covers both clinical and research domains. The schema centers around the general omics process flow, with concepts that denote the individual steps, such as sample processing, assay, and data processing. Genomics-specific specializations are provided, such as library preparation, sequencing assay, and sequencing analysis. The schema also facilitates in capturing other important omics metadata, such as information about the sequencing instrument, standard operating procedure, and quality control metrics. The extension aligns with existing semantic data models and reuses common biomedical vocabularies, such as EDAM, OBI and FAIR genomes, as value sets, thereby facilitating semantic interoperability. It will be used to FAIRify data that is produced within the Swiss network and to facilitate sharing this data as one knowledge graph for reuse among its participants.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Advances in sequencing and imaging technologies enable enhanced assessment in the prenatal space, with a goal to diagnose and predict the natural history of disease, to direct targeted therapies, and to implement clinical management, including transfer of care, election of supportive care, and selection of surgical interventions. The current lack of standardization and aggregation stymies variant interpretation and gene discovery, which hinders the provision of prenatal precision medicine, leaving clinicians and patients without an accurate diagnosis. With large amounts of data generated, it is imperative to establish standards for data collection, processing, and aggregation. Aggregated and homogeneously processed genetic and phenotypic data permits dissection of the genomic architecture of prenatal presentations of disease and provides a dataset on which data analysis algorithms can be tuned to the prenatal space. Here we discuss the importance of generating aggregate data sets and how the prenatal space is driving the development of interoperable standards and phenotype-driven tools.           ,              Key points                            What is already known about this topic?                                                                             Data organization, homogenous processing, and aggregation are crucial for elucidating the genotype/phenotype relationship.

  abstract = {Abstract                        Motivation             Qualifying variants (QVs) are genomic alterations selected by defined criteria within analysis pipelines. Although crucial for both research and clinical diag-nostics, QVs are often seen as simple filters rather than dynamic elements that influence the entire workflow. While best practices follow variant classification standards and standardised workflows, a unified framework to integrate and optimise QVs for advanced applications is missing.                                   Results             Our aim is to embed the concept of a ``QV'' into the genomic analysis vernacular, moving beyond a single filtering step. By decoupling QV criteria from other pipeline variables and code, our approach facilitates easier discussion and application. Our framework, with its new terminology and reference model, offers a flexible approach for integrating QVs into analysis pipelines, thereby enhancing reproducibility, interpretability, and interdisciplinary communication. A validation case study implementing ACMG criteria in a disease cohort shows that our approach matches conventional methods while offering improved clarity and scalability.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               The Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) Nomenclature is the global standard for describing and communicating variants in DNA, RNA, and protein sequences in clinical and research genomics. This manuscript details recent updates to the HGVS Nomenclature, highlighting improvements in governance, community engagement, website functionality, and underlying implementation of the standard.                                         Methods               The HGVS Variant Nomenclature Committee (HVNC) now operates under the Human Genome Organization (HUGO), facilitating broader community feedback and collaboration with related standards organizations. The website has been redesigned using modern documentation tools and practices. The specification was updated to include guidance for transcript selection and to align with recent cross-consortia recommendations for the representation of gene fusions. A formal computational grammar was introduced to improve the precision and consistency of variant descriptions.                                         Results               Major improvements in HGVS Nomenclature v. 21.1 include a redesigned website with enhanced navigation, search functionality, and mobile responsiveness; a new versioning policy aligned with software management practices; formal mechanisms for community feedback and change proposals; and adoption of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) for defining syntax. The specification now recommends MANE Select transcripts where appropriate and includes updated guidance for representing adjoined transcripts and gene fusions.

Conclusions               These advancements establish a more sustainable foundation for maintaining and evolving the HGVS Nomenclature while improving its accessibility and utility. The introduction of formal computational grammar marks a crucial step toward unambiguous variant descriptions that can be reliably processed by both humans and machines. Combined with enhanced community engagement mechanisms and improved guidance, these changes position the HGVS Nomenclature to better serve the evolving needs of clinical and research genomics while maintaining the stability that users require.},
