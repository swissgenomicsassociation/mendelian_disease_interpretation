  abstract = {Abstract             Advances in sequencing and imaging technologies enable enhanced assessment in the prenatal space, with a goal to diagnose and predict the natural history of disease, to direct targeted therapies, and to implement clinical management, including transfer of care, election of supportive care, and selection of surgical interventions. The current lack of standardization and aggregation stymies variant interpretation and gene discovery, which hinders the provision of prenatal precision medicine, leaving clinicians and patients without an accurate diagnosis. With large amounts of data generated, it is imperative to establish standards for data collection, processing, and aggregation. Aggregated and homogeneously processed genetic and phenotypic data permits dissection of the genomic architecture of prenatal presentations of disease and provides a dataset on which data analysis algorithms can be tuned to the prenatal space. Here we discuss the importance of generating aggregate data sets and how the prenatal space is driving the development of interoperable standards and phenotype-driven tools.           ,              Key points                            What is already known about this topic?                                                                             Data organization, homogenous processing, and aggregation are crucial for elucidating the genotype/phenotype relationship.                                                     Deep phenotyping improves molecular diagnosis.

  abstract = {Abstract                        Motivation             Qualifying variants (QVs) are genomic alterations selected by defined criteria within analysis pipelines. Although crucial for both research and clinical diag-nostics, QVs are often seen as simple filters rather than dynamic elements that influence the entire workflow. While best practices follow variant classification standards and standardised workflows, a unified framework to integrate and optimise QVs for advanced applications is missing.                                   Results             Our aim is to embed the concept of a ``QV'' into the genomic analysis vernacular, moving beyond a single filtering step. By decoupling QV criteria from other pipeline variables and code, our approach facilitates easier discussion and application. Our framework, with its new terminology and reference model, offers a flexible approach for integrating QVs into analysis pipelines, thereby enhancing reproducibility, interpretability, and interdisciplinary communication. A validation case study implementing ACMG criteria in a disease cohort shows that our approach matches conventional methods while offering improved clarity and scalability.
